      <p>Few have the opportunity to visit Q&rsquo;eros. It is a remote and very private community of a wonderful indigenous people who live high in the Andes. Those who are invited to meet them and travel to their out-of-this world beautiful home are changed forever.  In partnership with Q&rsquo;ero families from the villages of Qocha Moqo and Ch&rsquo;allmachimpana, Willka Yachay offers expeditions to individuals and groups who appreciate the Q&rsquo;eros, support their sustainable development, seek a strong intercultural connection with them and wish to learn from their teachings.</p>
