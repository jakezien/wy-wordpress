    <h2>Considered Peru&rsquo;s last Incan community, the Q&rsquo;eros Nation is a cultural treasure, yet its communities lack basics such as electricity, clean water, health care and food security.</h2>
    <h2>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s goal is to empower the next generation of the indigenous Q&rsquo;eros Nation of Peru to become leaders who elevate their standard of living, guide their community toward sustainable modernity and revitalize their cultural identity.</h2>

    <p>Willka Yachay builds schools high in the Andes. Mothers, fathers and elders play an integral role in designing and teaching innovative programming. Hands on student projects serve as community development initiatives.</p>
    <p>The Q&rsquo;eros people possess unique knowledge, from spiritual practices to farming to weaving. Yet their way of life is threatened. Many are migrating to urban areas for the sole purpose of educating their children. Families rarely return to the community after leaving. They have no health care, clean water or electricity. Food security is low. Child mortality is high. Q&rsquo;eros is a microcosm of the plight of native people worldwide as reported in the UN&rsquo;s State of the World&rsquo;s Indigenous Peoples.</p>
    <p>The Q&rsquo;eros are striving to sustain their indigenous Andean identity in the face of outward migration, large-scale mining, globalization and the arrival of a road. Willka Yachay and community members identified culturally relevant primary and secondary education in Q&rsquo;eros as the first step toward a sustainable future for their children and society.</p>

    <h2>Our Schools</h2>
    <p>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s team founded and sustains two community-based primary schools and a secondary school in Q&rsquo;eros. The schools teach the children to read and write in Quechua and Spanish and prepare them to interact with the modern world while preserving and nurturing their traditions. They will ultimately serve as community centers for education, nutrition, health care, and economic opportunity.</p>
    <h3>Primary Schools</h3>
    <p>Willka Yachay coordinates all fundraising and programming for two community-based primary schools: Inkari, in the village of Ch&rsquo;allma Chimpana, and Kusi Qoyllur, in Qocha Moqo. Qualified professors are teaching a combined total of forty children. The warm-hearted and creative children are enjoying an innovative education that respects and cultivates their culture.</p>
    <h3>Ethnic High School</h3>
    <p>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s ethnic high school, or Colegio Etnico, was founded in 2012 in the village of Qocha Moqo. The school is the first of its kind in Peru, and perhaps in the world, in that its curriculum is based on and nurtures a rich indigenous cultural heritage, while also teaching language and math skills through scientific, environmental and ethnographic projects. It provides an education that will enable young Q&rsquo;eros to go on to university, which none has ever done, and ultimately direct their community&rsquo;s future.</p>
